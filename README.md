# Point-and-Inverse-Camera-Projection
Implementation of forward (3D - 2D point) and inverse (2D point to 3D ray) camera projection, and to perform triangulation from two cameras to do 3D reconstruction from pairs of matching 2D image points

Dataset consists of 3D point data for each of 12 body joints for a set of motion capture frames recorded of a subject performing a Taiji exercise and camera calibration parameters
